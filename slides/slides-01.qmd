::: fragment
Ask questions at any point in the chat
:::

::: notes
we'll have lecture components with slides
demos where I'll show demo something and we'll discuss how it works
and interactive exercises where you'll do some coding
for these, I've set up a posit cloud project for you with everything you'll need
including api keys

if you have questions, you can put them in the chat at any time
I can't promise that I'll see them while I'm talking, but during the exercise portions
I'll monitor it and also consolidate questions to answer when we regroup

## Schedule

{{< partial ../partials/schedule.qmd >}}

::: notes
here's a rough schedule of what we're going to be covering today
this is only a two hour workshop, so there's a lot more to discover afterwards

my goal is to show you what's possible with llm apis from r and give you a good strating point
so you'll walk away understanding the basics of how to call llm apis from R,
build basic chatbots, hook LLMs up to external tools, and do some system prompt designing

:::

## How to get an API key, beyond this workshop {.center}

::: {.incremental .mt4}
1. 🆙 Sign up for an account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), etc.

2. 💳 Add a payment method

3. 🔑 Get an API key

4. 💾 Store it in `.Renviron` file<br>as `OPENAI_API_KEY`,  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc. 
:::

::: notes
this is likely what you'll want to do if you want to run the exercises locally after this workshop is over
:::

## But we'll give you API keys to use today! {.center}

::: incremental
1. Use these keys for all of our activities today -- *they are already set up in Posit Cloud!*

2. Play and explore! But please be considerate :)

3. We'll turn them off at the end of the workshop
