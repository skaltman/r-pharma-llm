## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer developers unprecedented programmatic capabilities. This workshop introduces ellmer (R) and chatlas (Python), Posit packages that simplify LLM API integration, handling conversation complexities and enabling seamless interactions with AI models.

Participants will explore system prompt design, token management, and tool calling while building familiarity with current AI technologies. The workshop demonstrates that:

- Coding with LLMs unlocks possibilities beyond standard tools
- No advanced AI background is required
- Implementing AI can be both accessible and exciting

Designed for AI newcomers and experienced developers, the session covers LLM integration, Shiny web app development, and touches on advanced topics like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool calling. Attendees will gain hands-on experience through guided exercises, providing the confidence to start their LLM journey.
