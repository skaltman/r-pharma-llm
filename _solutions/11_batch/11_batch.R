# Parallel structured extraction (fast, may be pricey) -------------------------

# Batch API (slower, but cheaper) ----------------------------------------------
# That was pretty easy! But what if we had 10,000 recipes to process? That would
# take a long time, and be pretty expensive. We can save money by using the
# Batch API, which allows us to send multiple requests in a single API call.
#
# With the Batch API, results are processed asynchronously and are completed at
# some point, usually within a few minutes but at most within the next 24 hours.
# Because batching lets providers schedule requests more efficiently, it also
# costs less per token than the standard API.

# Save the results -------------------------------------------------------------

# you've done that, you can open up `11_recipe-app.py` and run the app to see
# your new recipe collection!
